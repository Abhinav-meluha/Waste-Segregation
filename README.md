# Waste-Management
An Overview of the Project
This project’s main goal is to develop an AI-powered waste classification system using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
The system classifies waste images into three major categories — Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Hazardous — helping promote sustainability and automation in waste management for smart cities.
A MobileNetV2-based transfer learning model is used for efficient and accurate image recognition, while a Streamlit dashboard provides an intuitive and interactive interface for users to upload waste images and get real-time predictions.

Aims

Develop a deep learning model that can automatically classify waste into Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Hazardous categories.
Support smart city initiatives by enabling automated, AI-driven waste sorting.
Utilize transfer learning (MobileNetV2) for efficient training on limited datasets.
Deploy the model via Streamlit for real-time prediction and user interaction.
Provide clear and interpretable output with confidence levels and visual representation.

Specifications of the Model

Model Used: MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
Interface: Streamlit
Training Environment: Google Colab
Dataset Classes: 10 categories (Battery, Biological, Cardboard, Clothes, Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Shoes, Trash
Accuracy Achieved: ~93% Validation Accuracy
Optimizer: Adam
Learning Rate Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau
MobileNetV2 was chosen because of its:
High accuracy and efficiency on low computational power
Fast inference speed
Compatibility with lightweight deployment (Streamlit, mobile, web apps)

Process Workflow

1.Dataset Preparation:
Waste images were collected and organized into labeled folders.
The dataset was split into 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% testing.
2.Model Training:
The MobileNetV2 model was fine-tuned using pre-trained ImageNet weights on Google Colab.
Augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zoom) were applied to improve robustness.
3.Model Evaluation:
The model’s performance was evaluated using unseen images to ensure strong generalization and minimal overfitting.
4.Deployment:
A Streamlit dashboard was built for interactive usage — allowing users to upload an image and instantly receive a classification result with confidence levels.

Result

The trained AI model achieved high accuracy and reliability, successfully identifying waste materials under various lighting and background conditions.
The Streamlit interface provided real-time feedback, making it ideal for educational and industrial demonstrations.
This system can easily be scaled for smart waste management systems, assisting municipalities and environmental organizations in automating the waste segregation process.

How to Operate Locally

1️. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Waste-Classification-System.git

2️. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

4️. If using Google Colab
!streamlit run app.py & sleep 5 && cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8501 --no-autoupdate

Then, open the generated public URL to use the live classifier.

Potential Enhancements

Add more waste categories (metal, e-waste, food waste, paper, etc.)
1. Integrate with camera feeds or IoT sensors for real-time detection
2. Improve detection in low-light or outdoor conditions.
3. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces for global access.
4. Create a mobile version using TensorFlow Lite for on-site waste recognition.
 
Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision can contribute to environmental sustainability by automating waste classification.
Through data collection, model training, evaluation, and deployment on Streamlit, it covers the entire AI development lifecycle.
The Smart Waste Classification System offers a fast, reliable, and user-friendly solution for promoting eco-friendly practices in smart cities and beyond. ️
